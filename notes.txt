This is a list of notes that I am taking on observations of some of the
cleanest websites that I saw on cofolios.com.

-	White background with square/grid tiles to showcase projects
	*	Simple/no patterns
-	Navbar was simple
-	Tiles had hover-over effects that animate or provide information about
	the project
	*	Designs of the tiles brought to life the assignment
	*	A lot of experience related things
-	Two pages
	1)	Landing page
		*	Short description
		*	Projects
			^	Squares + hover effects
		*	Contact (Footer)
	2)	About page
		*	Personal statement
